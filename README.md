# The convolution for the mathematically mature reader

The markdown is an iPython notebook (made with Jupyter), available in the file `convolution2.ipynb`.

**Warning:** due to restrictions in the GitHub rendering of .ipynb markdowns, some of the animations and math formulas may not be shown properly. If such issues occur I recommend downloading the notebook and the `images` folder and opening `convolution2.ipynb` in Jupyter.
